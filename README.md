# make_work_easier
[Old version](https://github.com/Magic-wei/make_work_easier/tree/old)

This is a repo that investigates or develops tools to make work easier and enjoyable, especially for research stuffs, which has been refactored to focus on speeding up the following work flow when we're working on robotics research projects. Typically we have `Software Tools Recommendation` which is a list of powerful and useful tools for each topic (rectangle in the work flow), and `Code Snippets` which is a gallery for useful functions in Shell, Python, Matlab, C++ etc. If you have no idea about one of these specific topics, hope this repo could be the first place you should take a look at.

## Software Tools Recommendation



### Math Tools

### Diagrams & Flowcharts

* [draw.io](https://about.draw.io/): It is a free online diagram software for making flowcharts, process diagrams, org charts, UML, ER and network diagrams. You can use draw.io with your favourite cloud sharing service (e.g. Google Drive and OneDrive) or on your own device to synchronize your work.
* [Lucidchart](https://www.lucidchart.com/): another professional online flowcharts software. It can be used  for free under certain restrictions with limited space.
* [mermaid-live-editor](https://mermaidjs.github.io/mermaid-live-editor) for flowcharts and diagrams in markdown



### Coding





### Data Import & Export

Typically data can be stored in file formats like csv, txt, yaml, xml, xlsx etc. The very first and last steps are import data from files and export data to files.

| File Format | C++  | Python | Matlab |
| ----------- | ---- | ------ | ------ |
| txt         |      |        |        |
| csv         |      |        |        |
| xlsx        |      |        |        |



### Figure Plotting





### Visualization



### Video Recording

* [**Kazam**](https://launchpad.net/kazam) is a lightweight screen recorder software in Ubuntu. 
  * Known issue is, mp4 file generated by Kazam can't be opened correctly in Windows and also on some apps like Slack. For this case, you can use transcoder like [HandBrake](https://handbrake.fr/) which is a cross-platform to convert it to selected format.
* [**OBS Studio**](https://obsproject.com) is a cross platform, free and open source software for video recording and live streaming on Windows, Mac or Linux. You can set up an unlimited number of scenes and sources and switch between scenes seamlessly via custom transitions. Highly recommended for video recording. 
  * Known issue is, for Windows 10 1909 update or newer, it may have black screen issue (**usually for laptop that has more than one GPU**). You can follow the [solution to black screen issue](https://obsproject.com/forum/threads/laptop-black-screen-when-capturing-read-here-first.5965/) to resolve it. Unfortunately, even though you can resolve this issue to capture your whole screen, you might not be able to capture multimedia player windows (you can play multimedia files directly in OBS not capture the player window), but you can capture individual software windows like PyCharm, Matlab, Simulink etc. So it looks good for screen capture and most window captures.  **But it don't have such issue in Ubuntu.**

### Video Editing

* [**FFmpeg**](https://www.ffmpeg.org/) is a complete, cross-platform solution to record, convert and stream audio and video. Typically you can use it in command lines or GUI, and many popular video editors are developed based on FFmpeg. Some usage examples are as follows:
  * Transcoding: `ffmpeg -i input.mp4 output.avi`
  * Video clipping: `ffmpeg -i input.mkv -ss 11 -to 15 out.mkv` to get a video clip from 11 second to 15 second. You can also replace `-ss 11 -to 15` with `-ss 00:00:11 -to 00:00:15` or `-ss 00:11 -to 00:15` or `-ss 00:11 -t 5` where parameter `-t` devotes time duration.
  * Video Frame screenshot: `ffmpeg -i input.mkv -ss 5 -vframes 1 img.jpg` to get the 1st frame in the selected second.
  * Watermark: `ffmpeg -i input.mkv -i logo.png -filter_complex
    "[1]scale=192:108[b];[0][b]overlay=20:20" output.mkv` with parameter `scale` for resizing watermark and `overlay` for watermark location (top-left pixel location). Use `-filter_complex "overlay=20:20"` instead if you don't need to scale watermark.
  * Extract audio from video: `ffmpeg -i input.mkv -vn -acodec copy aout.m4a`
  * Remove audio from video: `ffmpeg -i input.mkv -vcodec copy -an vout.mkv`
  * Generate animated GIF: `ffmpeg -i input.mkv -ss 11 -to 15 -s 640x320 -r 15 out.gif` with paramter `-s` for frame scaling and `-r` for frame rate resetting.
  * Use FFplay to play a video or audio: `ffplay input.mkv`, press `Q` key to quit when finished.
* [**OpenShot**](https://www.openshot.org/) is a free & open-source cross-platform video editor. See [official guide](https://www.openshot.org/user-guide/) for more details about it.
