# make_work_easier
This is a repo that investigates or develops tools to make work easier and enjoyable, especially for research stuffs, which has been refactored to focus on speeding up the following work flow when we're working on robotics research projects. Typically we have `Software Tools Recommendation` which is a list of powerful and useful tools for each topic (rectangle in the work flow), and `Code Snippets` which is a gallery for useful functions in Shell, Python, Matlab, C++ etc. If you have no idea about one of these specific topics, hope this repo could be the first place you should take a look at.

### Diagrams & Flowcharts

* [draw.io](https://about.draw.io/): It is a free online diagram software for making flowcharts, process diagrams, org charts, UML, ER and network diagrams. You can use draw.io with your favourite cloud sharing service (e.g. Google Drive and OneDrive) or on your own device to synchronize your work.
* [Lucidchart](https://www.lucidchart.com/): another professional online flowcharts software. It can be used  for free under certain restrictions with limited space.
* [mermaid-live-editor](https://mermaidjs.github.io/mermaid-live-editor) for flowcharts and diagrams in markdown



### Coding





### Data Import & Export





### Figure Plotting





### Visualization



### Video Recording

* [Kazam](https://launchpad.net/kazam) is a lightweight screen recorder software in Ubuntu. 
  * Known issue is, mp4 file generated by Kazam can't be  opened correctly in Windows and also on some apps like Slack. For this case, you can use transcoder like [HandBrake](https://handbrake.fr/) which is a cross-platform to convert it to selected format, even mp4 to mp4, it works.
* [OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com) is a cross platform, free and open source software for video recording and live streaming on Windows, Mac or Linux. You can set up an unlimited number of scenes and sources and switch between scenes seamlessly via custom transitions. Highly recommended for video recording. 
  * Known issue is, for Windows 10 1909 update or newer, it may have black screen issue (**usually for laptop that has more than one GPU**). You can follow the [solution to black screen issue](https://obsproject.com/forum/threads/laptop-black-screen-when-capturing-read-here-first.5965/) to resolve it. Unfortunately, even though you can resolve this issue to capture your whole screen, you might not be able to capture multimedia player windows (you can play multimedia files directly in OBS not capture the player window), but you can capture individual software windows like PyCharm, Matlab, Simulink etc. So it looks good for screen capture and most window captures.  **But it don't have such issue in Ubuntu.**

### Video Editing

* [FFmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/) is a complete, cross-platform solution to record, convert and stream audio and video. Basically you can use it in command lines
