## Coding & Documentation

#### Markdown

- [**Typora**](https://typora.io/#): locally Markdown editor, cross-platform, free.
- [**MkDocs**](https://www.mkdocs.org/): a fast, simple and downright gorgeous static site generator that's geared towards building project documentation, cross-platform, free.
- [**github-markdown-toc**](https://github.com/Magic-wei/github-markdown-toc): A script that easily create Table of Content (TOC) for GitHub README.md, and for any Markdown file.
- [**Obsidian**](https://obsidian.md/): It is a powerful note-taking system that works on top of a local folder of plain text Markdown files. Free for personal use. Obsidian works pretty well with connections between notes with graph view and backlinks that can help you visualize and figure out those connections and locate the content you want very quickly. I really like the GUI, the smooth reaction, page preview, slide presentation like Marp, templates/macros settings. Many core plugins can be used to customize your own note-taking toolkit. And what you get is really a folder of Markdown files, which allow you to sync your notes anywhere and reuse them seamlessly. See the repo below for a nice template.
- [**Magic-wei/obsidian_wiki_template**](https://github.com/Magic-wei/obsidian_wiki_template): A personal wiki or note-taking system template based on Obsidian.

Such windows can be zoomed, rotated, flipped, made translucent, and even made click-through! If you are a programmer, a designer or whoever works much time before the computer, you will be surprised how it can help you get your work done more efficiently! **It has the free version for Windows and Mac OS**, and also a pro version as in-app purchase in Microsoft Store.
